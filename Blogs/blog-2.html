        <p >
            Hi everyone! I have been wanting to write blogs for a very long time about things
             that I think should be talked about more. They will be informative but at the same 
             time I will be writing more about my views on the topic, so think of it as an introduction 
             to interesting concepts/ topics which is followed by opinions of a non expert.  The topics have
              no range and you can recommend some too if you want to.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            Now the first topic I chose is <b>Cryptomnesia</b> or <b>inadvertent plagiarism</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason for selecting this topic comes from a place of diligent brainstorming for writing countless
             assignments in my college, only for them to get discarded because of plagiarism. The fact that I 
             started stand up comedy a year ago is how I was introduced to this concept.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            <b>Cryptomnesia is the phenomenon of recognizing a forgotten memory as something new or original.</b>
             Generally the memory returns in the form of an idea or intuition but reappearances in the form of
              actions have also been included.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            This phenomenon occurs in two ways; first is when one’s own thought returns as a brand new thought;
             the other way is when a ‘second hand thought’ is registered by a person knowingly or unknowingly in 
             their subconscious and gives birth to the delusion of having an original idea.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            The earliest recorded case of cryptomnesia dates back to 1874 when William Stainton
            Moses professed to contact the spirits of two brothers who had died in India. However, it was 
            discovered that six days prior to the Seance, an obituary  of the brothers had appeared in the
            newspaper. Moses’ information about the brothers didn’t surpass the information already given 
            in the obituary. Thus a conclusion was made that he had seen the obituary without making a conscious
            note of it.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            Perhaps the most famous example that I am sure you all will be aware of, thanks to CBSE, is <b>Helen Keller</b>.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            As she anecdotes in her autobiography <i>The Story of My Life</i>,
            Keller was just 11 years old when she submitted her story <i>The Frost King</i> in her school 
            which was later published to a broader audience.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            However, the very next year, it was discovered that the story had a strong resemblance, 
            including at least some lines, to another story entitled <i>Frost Fairies</i> by Margaret Canby.
            According to Keller, she could not recall having been read Frost Fairies or the book it was in.
            However, after some investigating (with the help of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell) it was discovered 
            that, while she didn’t own the book, she spent a summer a few years prior at the home of Sullivan’s
            mentor. There, she claimed, she was read the story. Although proven innocent by the school court
            (due to cryptomnesia) this incident was still very traumatic for Keller.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            Another interesting example of <b>self cryptomnesia</b> is Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.
            Steven wanted to cover a song called ‘You See Me Crying’ which, spoiler alert, is a
            song by <b>Aerosmith</b>. He had blocked out the memory of his own song, let alone other people’s
            work. The quote “That’s us d*ckhead“ was uttered by Joe Perry after listening to his band-mate.
        </p>

        <h2>The Social Experiment</h2>

        <p>
            in 1989, Southern Methodist University psychologist Alan S. Brown and PhD student Dana R.
            Murphy described a series of experiments demonstrating the phenomenon of cryptomnesia.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            In their first experiment, the researchers had groups of four participants generate words that
            belonged to a particular category like sports and musical instruments. Participants were told 
            not to generate words that had already been used. They took turns to come up with words until 
            everyone had contributed four words.  Later, they were asked to recall the four words that they 
            had generated for each category and to generate four completely new items.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            Results showed that cryptomnesia occurred in 3 to 9 percent of cases, with participants
            <b>inadvertently plagiarizing others’ contributions</b>  often when they tried to recall
            previously generated items. The researchers also found that participants rarely reused their
            own contributions (self-cryptomnesia), suggesting that people perceive their own and others’
            responses differently. Participants were also more likely to inadvertently plagiarize participants 
            whose responses immediately preceded their own. This suggested that they paid less attention 
            to incoming information when they were anticipating their own responses. This has something to 
            do with what we call High cognitive load, which I will cover in the latter half of this blog.
        </p>

        <h2>Cryptomnesia vs Plagiarism</h2>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            In my opinion, this has to be the most hotly debated dimension of cryptomnesia in the
            field of any art form. This is because of the amount of famous controversies involved 
            over the years; whether it is cinema, music industry or stand up comedy.  One might think 
            there must be a fine line between plagiarism and cryptomnesia? But sadly there is not, it’s 
            truly subjective.  Most of the times cryptomnesia is considered as an <b>“easy escape”</b> or excuse 
            for copying ideas from other people. In all fairness, denying to understand this concept of
            cryptomnesia doesn’t seem too far fetched for an artist who has probably put a lot efforts 
            to come up with something creative. Imagine working on an idea for years only for it to be
            plagiarized by someone else while also sharing all the <b>profits, fame & even its ownership.</b>
            That is why artistic innovation isn’t just birth of creativity anymore, it is a <b>race</b> to come
            up with something new before anybody else does. The early bird catches the worm indeed.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            Having said that, we cannot ignore the fact that even an ordinary person is consuming a mammoth
            amount of data from the internet on any given day. I think it is safe to say that not even 10% 
            of the content we come across everyday is remembered by our brain. Therefore, to think that a story,
            music beats or a joke is a new idea disguised as a forgotten memory is plausible.  What you <b>read</b>,
            what you<b> listen to</b> and what you <b>see</b> becomes the very substance of your <b>mind</b>. 
            I also believe that 
            in this modern era, no thoughts and ideas are completely new. Every creation is borrowed from past
            inventions or experiences. When it comes down to it, every idea is a curated version of different 
            ideas by several people. Idea isn’t singular, it’s a <b>network</b> so how can anyone own the idea that 
            didn’t fully belong to them in the first place? The person who invented a pencil-sharpener owes it 
            to the guy who thought of making pencils who in fact owes it to the creation of paper itself. As 
            an example, take any smartphone or car company; in this age of competition they are not just copying
            ach other but also getting away with it just by making a plagiarized feature better than the previous
            replica. This is plagiarism disguised as innovation, and not a lot of people seem to notice it.
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            Billions of people have a million experiences which can be expressed in a thousand
            different ways but there are only so many permutations & combinations of their thoughts
            that they are bound to be <b>common</b>. Every individual leads a different life but most of
            us grew up listening to the same stories about ‘good & bad’, read the same books, listened
            to the same tunes. Lets say that this is because we live in the same country; now imagine 
            how many experiences one might have with people they went to school with or visited the same 
            restaurants every weekend. I agree that everyone perceives an experience differently but the 
            point I am trying to make is that even though we are so different, we have A LOT of common 
            <b>‘checkpoints’</b> for our train of thoughts. There are literally hundreds of songs about “life” 
            and “love” but not one about <b>“nail cutters”</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            Cryptomnesia has not only destroyed careers, but also caused a crippling
            psychological fear in artists to ever write/work again. The worst part is
            that you cannot possibly search for every creation of an idea before putting
            it out there. Usually, it is hard to distinguish your thought from others’
            because of <b>high cognitive load</b> which means that your working memory is being 
            influenced by a number of elements interacting with each other at the same time. 
            Psychologists suggest that paying attention to the origin of any idea and reinforcement
            through use reduces the chances of this phenomenon. If you want to read more about this
            I would suggest a book called <b>Man and His Symbols</b> by Carl Jung.  
        </p>

        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">
            A very non-extensive research was done for writing this blog but I still hope I was able to
             get the idea across. Let me know what you think of this or if you have any recommendations for topics.
        </p>

        <h1 class="quouteh1">“The ability to reach a rich vein of such material[of the unconscious ]
            and to translate it effectively into philosophy, literature, music or scientific discovery
            is one of the hallmarks of what is commonly called genius.”</h1>
            <p style="color: #757575;">If the above quote seems too good to believe that I came up with it 
            then it’s probably because I didn’t think of it. Or I did…. and just forgot about it?</p>
