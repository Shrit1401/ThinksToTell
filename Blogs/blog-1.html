            I was just sitting and thinking about time travel,
            as a guy my age generally does, when this weird idea
            popped up into my head. Now I am aware that time travel
            is one of those topics that are too convoluted to even 
            understand, if not write. However, I will not be touching 
            the scientific side of it because if you have come all the
            way to read this, trust me, you deserve much more than just
            me posing to understand physics. This one is a non-informative 
            fun blog that I am writing to get my mind off of a few things; 
            I mean we do have a global pandemic over our heads. I have found 
            that writing works as a ‘getaway’ for a lot of things which, for the record, I do not
            advocate to be a good thing but that is also how I got into writing jokes. Anyway, if you’re
            actually into reading about the <b>science of temporality</b>, there are a bazillion better pieces
            of writing which I would be happy to recommend.  We all love to watch nonsensical time travel
            SCI-FIs, even if they are factually incorrect, because of their too good to be true element.
            Well this blog is directed towards the same lane and hopefully you get the picture I’m trying
            to paint. The idea isn’t worth all this build up but I would be lying if I said that I 
            didn’t have a feel-good moment when I thought of it.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting to The Point</h2>

        <p> Huge assumptions like the possibility of time travel have been made during the making
            of this blog. Yes, this is the year 2076; time travel is straight up possible and you
            have an opportunity to travel back/send somebody to <b>“the year of the virus.”</b> Modern
            science has overcome the temporal paradox, details of which have not been made public
            (for my convenience). This means that you can not only change the course of history but
            also come back to that version of reality wherein you originally had access to travelling 
            through time. However, there is a catch that you don’t look the same or the person you sent 
            is a stranger to your-2020-self.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now imagine being in a state of lockdown for almost three months due to the virus outbreak.
            You are on the verge of going crazy and it almost seems like the world is collapsing. This is 
            when you are approached by a random person who you don’t recognize and he tells you that he is 
            you from the future. This is it, the last straw; you have had enough of this old gentleman who 
            weirdly looks like a beatnik version of your forefathers. And just when you’re about to get rid of
            him, he says something absurd. Something so absurd that you believe him immediately.
        </p>

        <div class="mrk">-X-</div>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
            A few days prior to the present day you had come up with this idea (or read a blog about it?)
            in which you made a mental note of a very random phrase that you thought you would never hear
            unless your-future-self travels back in time. <b>“Magnetic turtles“</b> and <b>“31 droplets”</b> were respectively 
            the first two choices but you soon returned to your senses and thought of something better. It was
            important to remember the date because it would have been pointless if your future version had 
            travelled back to any date before you even decided <b>the phrase</b> itself.
        <p>
        <p>
            Now that you have absolute faith on <b>the stranger</b>, you shall do anything he says. After all, he is you from the 
            future, or maybe, just an imposter who second-guessed your phrase….

        <p>So there you have it, if I may be so bold to call it a – <b>password of trust.</b></p>
